  with as you please. You could for example use it for
  %ul
    %li household budgetting
    %li seeing how much organic vs non-organic produce you buy
    %li what items you buy the most


%p
  You can load this into pretty much any spreadsheet program such as
  #{link_to "OpenOffice", "https://www.openoffice.org/"},
  #{link_to "Google Docs", "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets"},
  or
  = link_to "Microsoft Office", "https://products.office.com"
  to do your own analysis. The data is downloaded as a
  = link_to "comma-separated values (CSV)", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values"
  file which is very widely supported.
